      I will soon complete my PhD in quantum computer science at the University of Edinburgh on the topic of control flow of quantum programs. I am also interested in the field of distributed quantum computing (which was the topic of my MSc by Research), classical computer science (e.g. complexity, computability, logic) and category theory. Originally trained as a computer engineer during my undergraduate studies, I later transitioned to theoretical and mathematical research. My current interest is on applying this theoretical knowledge to practical matters in quantum computing, helping to build bridges between disciplines and contributing to the development of quantum technologies with sights set on the future.
